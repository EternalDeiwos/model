## Background

## Install

```
$ npm install @trust/model --save
```

## Usage

```
const { DocumentModel, CryptoModel } = require('@trust/model')
```

`DocumentModel` and `CryptoModel` have equivalent functionality but extend different base classes. `CryptoModel` extends `JWD` from `@trust/jose`, which introduces various cryptographic functions. `DocumentModel` extends `JSONDocument` which `JWD` shares as a common ancestor. For more information please see [`@trust/jose`](https://github.com/anvilresearch/jose) and [`@trust/json-document`](https://github.com/anvilresearch/json-document).
